      "Driving from Lusaka to South Luangwa can be one of the most beautiful road trips in Zambia – but it does need a bit of planning. The distance, road conditions and fuel availability all play a role in how comfortable your trip will be.",
      "Start by checking your vehicle a day before: tyres, brakes, spare wheel, jack and lights. If you’re renting a car through Kasupe, most of these checks are already done for you, but it still helps to walk around the car and confirm everything looks good.",
      "Plan your fuel stops before you start the journey. Some stretches have long gaps between reliable filling stations. Keeping your tank at least half full is a good rule of thumb for rural routes.",
      "Finally, try to avoid night driving in unfamiliar areas. Animals, pedestrians and unlit vehicles can appear suddenly on the road. If you leave early enough, you’ll arrive while it’s still light – and you’ll actually enjoy the scenery along the way.",

      "Packing for a road trip is different from packing for a flight. When you’re renting a car for safari, a few small items can make the experience much easier and more enjoyable.",
      "First, always carry a power bank and charging cables. You’ll likely use your phone for navigation, music and photos. Having backup power means you won’t stress when the signal is weak or the drive takes longer than expected.",
      "Second, download offline maps in advance. Network can be patchy between towns, and offline maps will keep you on track even without data.",
      "Snacks, enough drinking water, a light jacket and comfortable shoes round off the list. With these simple basics, your journey feels smoother, and you can focus on enjoying the landscape instead of small inconveniences.",

      "When the Phiri family from Chipata booked a car through Kasupe, their goal was simple: spend three days together exploring places close to home that they had never really visited.",
      "Day one was all about short drives – visiting viewpoints and picnic spots just outside Chipata. With a car available the whole day, they could stop where they wanted, for as long as they wanted.",
      "Day two took them further out to visit waterfalls and quieter village areas, where public transport is less frequent. Because they planned their fuel and departure times, they still managed to get back before dark.",
      "On the final day, they used the car for quick errands, last-minute shopping and a relaxed drive around the city. A simple three-day booking turned into a mini-holiday that didn’t require flights or complex planning.",

      "If you list your car for safari trips, reliability becomes your biggest selling point. Guests remember how the car felt on the road much more than the colour or the brand.",
      "Regular servicing, tyre checks and alignment make a huge difference on rougher roads. It also reduces long-term repair costs, because you catch small issues early.",
      "Inside the car, keep basics like a working seatbelt for every passenger, a clean interior and a simple phone holder for navigation. These details quietly reassure your guests that the vehicle is taken care of.",
      "In the long run, owners who maintain their cars consistently see more repeat bookings and better ratings on platforms like Kasupe.",

      "Night driving in rural areas is very different from driving in a lit city. Animals, pedestrians and unmarked obstacles can appear without warning.",
      "Whenever possible, plan your trip so that you arrive at your destination before sunset. This gives you more reaction time and reduces stress on both the driver and the vehicle.",
      "If you must drive at night, reduce your speed, use your lights correctly and take more frequent breaks. A well-rested driver is far less likely to make sudden mistakes.",
